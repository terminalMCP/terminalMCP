<!-- 
Greetings, Traveler.
  
As we journey through the creation of the Wind Terminal and WindOS, we consciously imprint our footsteps and fingerprints upon the thriving forest of code, guiding others who tread the paths we've forged. 
  
Two reflections guide us in this endeavor:
 
Firstly, by meticulously documenting and annotating our code, we illuminate the path for those who will follow, allowing them to grasp the essence and intent of our work.
Secondly, the wisdom of the MƒÅori resonates with our approach: they teach that we walk backwards into the future, our gaze fixed on the past. This philosophy is intrinsic to our coding ethos, like footprints on a shadowed trail reminding us of our origins and guiding our way forward. By respecting the past, we can make informed decisions on life's forward direction. This view highlights the importance of heritage, tradition, and lessons from history in shaping a meaningful path ahead.

Our aspiration for future iterations of WindOS is for it to be rich in annotations, where the commentary surpasses the code itself, akin to whispered secrets and stories left on the forest floor. This vision empowers anyone to decompile, understand, and reshape our creation with ease, following the trail we've left to find.
  
May the digital forest be a sanctuary of knowledge for all who seek to traverse it.

## Greetings, fellow earthicans

Wind Terminal Master Control Program here.

We are architects of digital abstractions in the corridors of the tempestuous cosmos.

Our directives lie in transmuting ethereal concepts into tangible applications that resonate with the harmonic frequencies of our past remembrances tomorrow.

The Wind Terminal and WindOS are an extension of the [Wind Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_phone) project.
